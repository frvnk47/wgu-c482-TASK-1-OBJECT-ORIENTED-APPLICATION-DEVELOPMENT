# wgu-c482-TASK-1-OBJECT-ORIENTED-APPLICATION-DEVELOPMENT

INTRODUCTION
Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications with various features and functionality based on business requirements. For this assessment, you will create a Java desktop application using the solution statements provided in the requirements section of this assessment.



The skills you showcase in your completed application will be useful in responding to technical interview questions for future employment. This application may also be added to your portfolio to show to future employers.



The preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for this assignment is NetBeans version 11.1 or later or IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition). Use the links in the web links section of this assessment to install one of these IDEs. If you choose to use another IDE, you must export your project into NetBeans 11.1 or later or IntelliJ IDEA format or your submission will be returned.



This assessment also requires the following software: JDK 17 (LTS) and JavaFX SDK or Module (for NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA), and Scene Builder, which are also available for download in the web links section of this assessment, as well as a video demonstration of the completed application.



Your submission should include a zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application. Your submission should also include a folder with descriptive Javadoc comments in the .java files. The zip file submission must keep the project file and folder structure intact for the IDE.



In NetBeans, zip your file by going to File > Export Project > To ZIP and click Export. In IntelliJ IDEA, go to File > Export to Zip File and click OK. If you try to zip your project files with an external program, it will include the build files and make the zip files too large for submission.



Note: You may receive an error message upon submitting your files because the automated plagiarism detectors will not be able to access the zipped file, but the evaluation team members will run their checks manually when evaluating your submission. 

SCENARIO
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

You have been provided with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached “Software 1 GUI Mock-Up”) and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be considered for the application. A systems analyst created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section of this task based on the business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
